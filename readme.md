	- [ ] each non-host user's screen should poll the db to see when it starts

		- [ ] phase done check
			- [ ] any messages from that phase?

		- [ ] witch wake-up
			- [ ] if no witch: goto next phase
			- [ ] if witch: send message
				- [ ] witch updates player positions &/ views card and then clicks "done" on the message
			- [ ] if done: goto next phase
			- [ ] if not done: check again...
